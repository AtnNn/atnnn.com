I havenâ€™t posted anything here in a long time, so I thought I might share a small log from freenode.

```irc
* s0lidnuts has joined ##prolog
< s0lidnuts> Hi. I'd like a commented version of the solution to the 8 queen
             problem. I do not know prolog nor have time to learn it now (school
             work). Anyone willing to help please pvt =)
< AtnNn> s0lidnuts: eight_queens([2,4,6,8,3,1,7,5]).
< s0lidnuts> AtnNn that's cheating
```

Somehow, this made me laugh more than anything else has this past week.
