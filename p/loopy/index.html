<p>Also called Slither Link or Loop The Loop, Loopy is one of the many types of puzzles that came out of Japan. It is part of <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/">Simon Tatham’s Puzzle Collection</a>, and can be played online on <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/java/loopy.html">his site</a>, at <a href="http://www.nikoli.com/en/puzzles/slitherlink/">Nikoli</a> and on <a href="http://puzzle-loop.com/">puzzle-loop.com</a>.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
<p>The goal of the game is to draw a single loop that never crosses itself, with a simple restriction: squares containing a number must have exactly that many sides that are part of the loop.</p>
<h2 id="simple-properties">Simple Properties</h2>
<p>Some simple properties can be easily derived from the rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every dot touches exactly zero or two segments of the loop.</li>
<li>Any line or squiggle that crosses the board will intersect the loop an even amount of times.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="patterns">Patterns</h2>
<p>Tatham’s downloadable version of the game is the best version I could find, but it does not include a timer nor does it keep score like minesweeper does on windows. Speed runs are still possible, but intimate knowledge of many types of patterns is required.</p>
<h2 id="corner-patterns">Corner Patterns</h2>
<p>Corner patterns usually appear in the corners, but some of them also apply when the numbered square has a corner in common with a 0. The patterns for a 1 and a 3 are easy, but it is a little less obvious for 2.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../images/loopy/corners-1.png" alt />

</div>
<p>In Tatham’s version and in other versions with a unique solution, when a 2 is completely alone in a corner, 6 segments can be filled in.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<h2 id="side-pattern">Side Pattern</h2>
<p>When a 3 and a 1 are together on the side, another simple deduction can be made.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../images/loopy/side-1.png" alt />

</div>
<h2 id="patterns-with-3">Patterns with 3</h2>
<p>The 3 square is very special because all but one of its sides are in the loop. It is often easy to predict two of it’s sides.</p>
<p>A dot with two diagonal 1s and a 3 will always be part of the loop. The 1s always shoot inward.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../images/loopy/3-1-1.png" alt />

</div>
<p>When 3s touch diagonally, they shoot at each other and fly away from each other.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../images/loopy/3-3.png" alt />

</div>
<p>When they share a side, they make a parallel formation. The two segments that continue the middle segment are never part of the loop.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../images/loopy/3-3-3.png" alt />

</div>
<h2 id="a-little-vocabulary">A little vocabulary</h2>
<p>I invented my own vocabulary to make discussing loopy easier.</p>
<p>Shooting: When two adjacent sides of a square contain one and exactly one segment of the loop.</p>
<p>Flying: When two adjacent sides of a square are both part of the loop. The shape looks like an arrow, a plane or a bird.</p>
<p>Turret: A 2 with a side that is known not to be part of the loop.</p>
<p>This vocabulary allows me to say that 2s shoot sideways when they fly and that 3s fly away when they are shot.</p>
<h2 id="patterns-with-2">Patterns with 2</h2>
<p>The interesting thing with 2s is that shooting and flying propagates along diagonal 2s.</p>
<p>For example, two 3s connected by 2s can still shoot at each other and fly away.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../images/loopy/3-2-2-3.png" alt />

</div>
<p>A 2 in a corner or diagonally across from a 0 is a flying 2. It flies towards the corner or away from it, and it shoots sideways.</p>
<p>It is impossible to fly into a 3, so flying 2s always fly away from 3s that are directly in their path.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../images/loopy/2-3-Fly.png" alt />

</div>
<p>Flying 2s shoot sideways at 3s that are on the side.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../images/loopy/2-3-Shoot.png" alt />

</div>
<p>A 3 that has a side in common with a flying 2 will fly away, at a 90 degree angle with the flight path.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<h2 id="turrets">Turrets</h2>
<p>It is common to have a 2 with a side that is not part of the loop. I call them turrets. Turrets behave like 3s because all but one of their unknown sides are part of the loop.</p>
<p>Like 3s, turrets love to shoot at each other and at 3s.</p>
<p>Unlike 3s, turrets cannot fly away. When they shoot on one side they get a leg on the other side.</p>
<p>Turrets automatically appear when a 2 shares a side with a 0. In this example, a turret and a 3 are shooting at each other.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../images/loopy/2-3-Turret.png" alt />

</div>
<p>A 3 on top of a turret (that is, on the opposite side of the turret’s empty side) always has a segment of the loop on the side opposite of the turret.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../images/loopy/0-2-3.png" alt />

</div>
<h2 id="combining-patterns">Combining Patterns</h2>
<p>A parallel formation of 3s next to a few well placed 2s often creates a nice avalanche of turrets.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../images/loopy/3-3-2-2-2.png" alt />

</div>
<h2 id="other-inferred-rules">Other inferred rules</h2>
<p>There are a lot of other patterns, I won’t mention hem all. They can all be discovered by simply applying the rules or by using brute force.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Shooting a wall turns the wall into a segment of the loop.</p>
<p>Flying into a wall or away from a wall removes the side on the wall from the loop.</p>
<p>Shooting a 1 removes it’s opposite sides from the loop.</p>
<p>Flying into a 1 or away from a 1 makes it shoot away from you.</p>
<p>When a segment is in line to shoot a turret or a 3, it always does. The other side is not part of the loop.</p>
<p>When a segment is in line with a flying 2, it flies towards the 2 and the 2 flies away.</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>
