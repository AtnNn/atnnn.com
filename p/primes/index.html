<pre><code>&lt;AtnNn&gt; all odd numbers are prime, except for 2
&lt;bob&gt; 25 isn't prime.
&lt;bob&gt; And 2 is an even number.
&lt;AtnNn&gt; 25 has a 2
&lt;AtnNn&gt; i said, except for 2
&lt;bob&gt; 35
&lt;AtnNn&gt; 35 is not odd
&lt;AtnNn&gt; i said, all odd numbers
&lt;bob&gt; Yes it is.
&lt;bob&gt; 35 is an odd number.
&lt;AtnNn&gt; prove it
&lt;bob&gt; It can't be split evenly into two parts.
&lt;AtnNn&gt; yes. 3 and 5
&lt;bob&gt; Eh?
&lt;AtnNn&gt; or 4 and 4 to make it even
&lt;bob&gt; 35
&lt;bob&gt; not 4 and 4
&lt;bob&gt; 4 and 4 is 8
&lt;AtnNn&gt; yes, first you divided into 2
&lt;AtnNn&gt; which is 3 and 5
&lt;AtnNn&gt; and then you balance it, which gives you 4 and 4
&lt;bob&gt; 35/2 == 17.5
&lt;bob&gt; You don't balance anything when determining even or odd.
&lt;bob&gt; You divide by 2 to determine that.
&lt;AtnNn&gt; what does dividing by 2 prove?
&lt;AtnNn&gt; any number can be divided by two except itself
&lt;bob&gt; A prime number is a number
&lt;bob&gt; that can only be divided by 1 and itself.
&lt;bob&gt; 2,3,5,7,11,13, etc
&lt;AtnNn&gt; any number can be divided by any other number
&lt;AtnNn&gt; except zero and negative infinity
&lt;AtnNn&gt; btw you skipped 9
&lt;bob&gt; 9 isn't prime
&lt;bob&gt; 9/3 = 2
&lt;AtnNn&gt; yes it is. it is odd
&lt;bob&gt; Nope, not prime
&lt;AtnNn&gt; yes
&lt;bob&gt; By 1, and itself only
&lt;bob&gt; 9 divided by 3 is 2
&lt;AtnNn&gt; i can divide 13 by 78, but it still is prime
&lt;bob&gt; It has to return a whole number
&lt;bob&gt; 78/13 isn't a whole number
&lt;bob&gt; 78 isn't prime either
&lt;bob&gt; 78/2 ==39
&lt;AtnNn&gt; yes, 78/13 is a whole number
&lt;bob&gt; Oh, I'm sorry
&lt;bob&gt; You're right
&lt;AtnNn&gt; you see, im right
&lt;bob&gt; But 78 isn't prime
&lt;AtnNn&gt; no, 78 isnt odd
&lt;bob&gt; No, it isn't
&lt;AtnNn&gt; so its not prime
&lt;AtnNn&gt; all odd numbers are prime
&lt;bob&gt; &lt;AtnNn&gt; i can divide 13 by 78, but it still is prime
&lt;bob&gt; No, they aren't.
&lt;bob&gt; 35/5 = 6
&lt;AtnNn&gt; except for 2
&lt;AtnNn&gt; 5 is prime...
&lt;bob&gt; Doesn't matter.
&lt;AtnNn&gt; its odd and its prime, so im right
&lt;AtnNn&gt; why do you even argue?
&lt;bob&gt; http://primes.utm.edu/lists/small/1000.txt
&lt;bob&gt; Because I'm right.
&lt;AtnNn&gt; 1000 isnt prime
&lt;bob&gt; No, it isn't.
&lt;AtnNn&gt; but why all these other numbers
&lt;AtnNn&gt; why do you say that 9 isnt prime?
&lt;bob&gt; Those are the first 1000 prime numbers
&lt;AtnNn&gt; its odd
&lt;bob&gt; Because
&lt;bob&gt; 9 can be divided by 3
&lt;bob&gt; 9/3 = 3
&lt;AtnNn&gt; you said that 7 was prime
&lt;AtnNn&gt; but it can be divided by 3 to
&lt;bob&gt; 7 can't be divided and return a whole number.
&lt;bob&gt; 7/3 =3.5
&lt;AtnNn&gt; no, 3.5 isnt whole
&lt;AtnNn&gt; 7/3 is whole
&lt;AtnNn&gt; 3.5 != 7/3
&lt;AtnNn&gt; stop trying to mess around with my head
&lt;bob&gt; Lmao
&lt;bob&gt; Get a calculator.
&lt;bob&gt; 7 divided by 3
&lt;bob&gt; Sorry, I was mistaken
&lt;bob&gt; I was thinking 7/2
&lt;bob&gt; 2.33~
&lt;AtnNn&gt; 2.33~ is a whole number
&lt;bob&gt; No, it's not.
&lt;bob&gt; It's a decimal.
&lt;AtnNn&gt; i could write it in octal if you want
&lt;AtnNn&gt; it would still be whole
&lt;bob&gt; Lmao.
&lt;bob&gt; You have to be messing with me. =)
&lt;AtnNn&gt; you are very odd
&lt;AtnNn&gt; you must be prime
&lt;bob&gt; Indeed I am.</code></pre>
